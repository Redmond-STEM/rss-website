    <p>At Redmond STEM, we make learning fun for all ages, while still provinding a good introduction to our students on
      a topic, so they remain interested for years to come, and can even carry their knowledge into a higher education.
      Focusing primarily on grades 5-8, learning should be fun and interesting for the student, and our curriculum does
      just that, ensuring the child continues to enjoy the subject even after the course has ended.
